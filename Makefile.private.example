# This file is meant for private variables and targets that apply only to each person's
# local developments variables (ie. configurations specific to your own local
# development environment) as well as sensitive information, like access keys,
# passwords and such.
#
# Ex. personal targets while exploring new parameters or configurations that should not
# be share with other project members

# Make a copy of this file and name it `Makefile.private`, then define your own
# variables in it.

# DO NOT COMMIT YOUR `Makefile.private`!!!


## Private variables

# Most, but not all install/remove targets use this variable. A 'false' value will ask
# users to confirm some steps. A 'true' value will automatically install/remove without
# asking beforehand.
AUTO_INSTALL := false

# The default environment to use. The choices are as follow: [venv, poetry, conda]
# If this is not set, the makefile will use the `poetry` command without activating
# an environment before hand.
DEFAULT_INSTALL_ENV := venv

# The default environment where Poetry will be installed. The choices are as follow: [venv, conda]
# If this is not set, the makefile will ask the user where they want to install Poetry
#DEFAULT_POETRY_INSTALL_ENV := venv


# This variable is to enable the '-y' flag when newer version of conda is available.
# The default Mila conda module does not allow this flag; leave blanks or commented out
#CONDA_YES_OPTION := -y

# If you use a different Conda tool, say `micromamba`, or if you use a different alias
# CONDA_TOOL := <YOU_CONDA_TOOL_IF_DIFFERENT_FROM_CONDA>
DOCKER_COMPOSE := docker compose
