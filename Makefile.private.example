## Private variables

# If you use a different Conda tool, say `micromamba`, or if you use a different alias
# CONDA_TOOL := <YOU_CONDA_TOOL_IF_DIFFERENT_FROM_CONDA>
DOCKER_COMPOSE := docker compose

# Some targets use this variable. A 'false' value will ask user to confirm some steps.
# a 'true' value will automatically install/remove without asking beforehand.
AUTO_INSTALL := false

# The default environment to use. The choices are as follow: [venv, poetry, conda]
# If this is not set, the makefile will use the `poetry` command without activating
# an environment before hand.
DEFAULT_INSTALL_ENV := conda

# The default environment where Poetry will be installed. The choices are as follow: [venv, conda]
# If this is not set, the makefile will ask the user where they want to install Poetry
DEFAULT_POETRY_INSTALL_ENV := venv
