# Geospatial tools

## Description

This repository is a collection of tools and scripts for geospatial use cases.

For more detailed information on how to install, configure and develop a project
using this repository, please refer yourself to the project's
[README](https://github.com/RolnickLab/geospatial-tools/blob/main/README.md)

## Requirements

This project has only been tested in a Linux (Debian based) environment and assumes
some basic tools for development are already installed.

The project uses a Makefile to automate most operations. If `make` is available on your
machine there's a good chance this will work.

## Python Version

This project uses Python version 3.11

## Build Tool

This project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as a build tool. Using a build tool has the advantage of
streamlining script use as well as fix path issues related to imports.
