# Makefile documentation

This folder contains the base makefile targets.

It should not be modified outside of the [Template's repository](https://github.com/RolnickLab/lab-advanced-template).

If there is a problem with the contents of these targets, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/RolnickLab/lab-advanced-template/issues).

If you know how to fix the problem, please also consider opening a pull request with 
your proposed solution.

You can always override the faulty targets located here by creating new targets
with the same names inside [Makefile.targets](../Makefile.targets).

The Makefile and `bump-my-version` related files in this directory are to help with
change tracking for the makefile itself. If you are using this makefile as part of a
